This repository is home to the supporting tutorial for my article ‘Distributional thinking about film style: quantile comparisons of motion picture shot length data.’

**Abstract**

In this article I illustrate the use of quantiles as a means of describing and comparing motion picture shot length distributions. This approach is conceptually and computationally simple and leads us to think distributionally about shot lengths rather than focussing on individual values. The result is a better understanding of how this element of film style of two (or more) films differs.

In this tutorial I demonstrate the code used in my article so that those who would like to use quantile-based methods in their own research into shot length distributions may do so. The data used in my article is also avilable in the Data folder of this repository.
